there is a pyramid with 1 cup at level , 2 at level 2 , 3 at level 3 and so on.. 
It looks something like this 
1 
2 3 
4 5 6 
every cup has capacity C. you pour L liters of water from top .
when cup 1 gets filled , it overflows to cup 2,3 equally, and when they get filled , 
Cup 4 and 6 get water only from 2 and 3 resp but 5 gets water from both the cups and so on. 
Now given C and M .Find the amount of water in ith cup.





pbulic class Solution{

    public double calculate(double c , double l , int k ){
        int row = Math.sqrt(k*2);
        int col = k- row*(row-1)/2;
        if(k == 1) return l;
        int left=0 ,right=0;
        if(col > 1) left = calculate(c,l,k - row);
    }
    ...   no sprite
