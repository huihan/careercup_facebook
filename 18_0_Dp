Given an array write a function to print all continuous subsequences in the array which sum of 0. 
e.g: 
Input: 
Array = [-1, -3, 4, 5, 4] 
output: 
-1, -3, 4

This is not the best dynamic programming method.
A simple way is,
use an array sum[i] to present the sum from data[0] to data[i]. A special 0 at beginning to simplify the logic later.
Then, just find the same values in sum[].
For example,
[-1, -3, 4, 5, -2, -7]
[0, -1, -4, 0, 5, 3, -4]
There is a pair 0, that mean the range from 0 to 2.
Another pair -4, that means the range form 2 to 5.

A hash can be used to find the same value pair.
Space: O(N)
Time: O(N)
